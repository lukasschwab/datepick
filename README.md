# datepick

Minimal date-picker terminal UI.

Standalone version of the `date` date-picker command https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum/pull/683 would add to `gum`.

## Usage

Pick a date, starting from the current date by default:

```bash
datepick
```

Or starting from an initial date of your choosing:

```bash
datepick --value 2023-11-28
```
